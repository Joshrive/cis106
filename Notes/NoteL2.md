## Lecture 2 Notes

#### What is Virtualization?

**The basics:**
Running a virtual instance of a computer system inside a physical machine.
Two types of Virtualization:
    - Server Side
    - Client Side
Difference between the two is where the virtualization takes place. 

**Server side Virtualization**
Server side virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI):
    - Think client or fat client
    - Thin client
    - Zero Client

**Client-side virtualization**
    - Software installed on a PC to manage a VM and each VM will have its own OS installed. 
For client side virtualization, you will need a hypervisor which is a software that allows the management of VMs and hardware to support the VMs.
