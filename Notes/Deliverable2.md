# Deliverable 2

The students will list and provide a brief description of the resources that are being used to complete the project. Also, the student will provide a brief explanation of the technologies that he is learning in order to complete the project.

For my project I will be using information provided on the wiki-Minecraft site as well as the minecraft help site. Also, I am a firm believer that Youtube is also a great tool for learning new skills.
I have learned a lot from youtube outside of the class work. 

I will be learning how to create users and assigning admin rights. 
I will learn how to configure firewall access as well as working without a GUI which I think will be challenging because I am used to working and doing everything on Windows OS.
