# Homework 2 | Research free software/open source software alternatives.
**Student** Joshua Rivera
**Course:** CIS 106

Answer the following question:

##### 1. What are the advantages of open source?
Open sources software is cost-effective as most are free to use. You are able to inspect, copy, modify the programing and use in any way the user prefers. 
Students can study the programs and it can also be easily distributed across an enterprise. 

##### 2. What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source?
You can use the software in any way you want. For example students can study the programs and learn how things work.

##### 3. Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version?
People should try it but some people might think it isn't reliable or safe due to it being free. But that is not the case.
With the freedom of being able to modify softwares, you gain much more control and freedom over the product. 

##### 4. Do you agree with Richard Stallman? Do you disagree? Explain your answer. 
I agree with Richard in regards free software. I believe if a person is paying for a particular product, them as "owners" should have complete freedom to do as they want with it. 
Why would I want to pay more for a product key and be forced to use certain browsers or not being able to remove them. My control should not be limited and personally if I am paying big bucks for a software and still be restricted on how I want to use the software, I would not be paying full price for it at all.

Sadly your average users simply to not care about freedom over softwares because they just do not understand.
