# Homework 3 Finding a Linux Distributions to Solve Specific Problems.

Given the scenario, use the internet or go straight to Distrowatch to find a Linux distribution that will fit best. You need to explain your answers in at least 1 paragraph. (4 to 8 sentences). For each distribution provide the following information:
* What is it based on? (Debian, Slackware, Redhat, Arch, etc)
* URL to where it can be downloaded from.
* The Supported processor architecture (x86, x86_64, arm, etc)
  
## Scenario 1: Using a Live Linux Installation

John is fixing Mario’s laptop. He needs to prepare a live USB flash drive that he can boot Linux from so that he can access some important information. The problem is that he only has a 4GB flash drive available. Which Linux distribution would you advise John to use to prepare the live USB installation?

![PuppyLinux](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Banner_logo_Puppy.png/220px-Banner_logo_Puppy.png) | Puppy Linux is independent based. Architecture is i686, x86 and 64. This distribution is extraordinarilly small. Fits into a USB Stick providing full features booted right off the USB. John should have no problem using his 4GB stick for this as Puppy Linux will only take up about 600 MB.  | https://puppylinux.com/

## Scenario 2: Using Linux for parental control
Mario is concerned about his children using the house computer. He has an older laptop that he has not used in a while and has hired you to prepare that laptop for his children to use. Mario wants the children to use the computer mostly for educational purposes so he asks you to install educational tools in it. He is also concerned about his children using the internet so asks you if you could somehow install a web browser/search engine that has parental control or at least blocks adult content. Mario has given you $150 dollars for upgrades so that if needed you can proceed without contacting him. Which Linux distribution would install in Mario’s older laptop?

![lubuntu](https://lubuntu.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Lubuntu_logo.svg)| Lubuntu is based off debian/ubuntu. It supports x86_64 i686 and includes all essential applications for daily use. This distribution is available for both 32-bit and 64-bit computers, Lubuntu is intended to be user-friendly, lightweight and energy efficient. Great for older computers. You can set parental controls on lubuntu as well. This would be a good distribution for Mario's older laptops. | https://lubuntu.net/

## Scenario 3: Linux + Gaming
Johanna is a gamer. She loves playing RPGs and Indie games. Johanna makes a living streaming her gaming sessions on Twitch and YouTube. She is angry because, during one of her live streams, windows 10 decided to install an update. All of Johanna’s games are available for Linux and she is good enough with computers to be able to pick up using a new operating system. Which Linux distribution would you recommend Johanna to try?

![Ubuntu](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/8dd99b80-ubuntu-logo14.png) | Johanna should use one of the most popular distros which is Ubuntu. For Linux users, most of the games that they want to play can be found on Steam, an online platform from which users can buy, play, and download games. On Steam, Ubuntu sits at the top as the most-used distribution for gaming, and this comes as no surprise, as this distribution is easy-to-use, immensely popular, and extremely user-friendly. Ubuntu also allows for the easy installation of the tools and packages required for gaming, such as automatically installing proprietary NVIDIA graphics drivers. You can also easily install software like Lutris, GameHub, or Steam Proton to play Windows games on your Linux system. | https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop

## Scenario 4: Reviving an old PC
Giorgina has an old computer that came with Windows Vista. She cannot afford to buy a new computer or update her current PC. Her computer is used for online shopping, reading emails, paying her bills, and listening to music. All her music is on an external hard drive and she normally does not keep important information on her computer. Georgina is willing to pay you to make her computer faster. You have concluded that installing Linux is the simplest and most cost-efficient way to help her. However, in such an old PC, Ubuntu 20.04 will be almost as slow as Windows 10 so you need to find another distribution that is much lighter on system resources and has been designed for running on older hardware. Which distribution will you install in Georgina’s ~~dinosaur~~ PC?

![xubuntu](https://distrowatch.com/images/yvzhuwbpy/xubuntu.png) | I have personally used this OS to revive a few of my old laptops and PCs. This is a lightweight distribution based on Debian/Ubuntu. Supports i686, x86_64. Lightweight for older hardware and I think would be a good option for Georgina to try. I am sure it will be an improvement over windows 10 | https://xubuntu.org/
